Training Language Models with Language Feedback\n- **Authors**: Jérémy Scheurer, Jon Ander Campos, Jun Shern Chan\n- **Year**: 2022\n- **Source**: arXiv:2204.14146\n- **Key Contribution**: Proposes learning from natural language feedback instead of scalar rewards\n- **Relevance**: Alternative to RLHF that could address sycophancy\n\n---\n\n## Common Methodologies\n\n### Self-Critique Approaches\n1. **Self-Refine (Madaan et al.)**: Generate → Feedback → Refine iteratively\n2. **Distilled Self-Critique**: Gibbs sampling to refine outputs, then distillation\n3. **Constitutional AI**: Self-critique against principles\n4. **CriticBench evaluation**: Critique-then-correct paradigm\n\n### Prompt Engineering Methods\n1. **Tone/Politeness variation**: Ranging from very polite to very rude\n2. **Role-playing/Persona prompts**: Acting as harsh critic\n3. **Chain-of-Thought**: Step-by-step reasoning\n4. **Instruction tuning**: Fine-tuning on critique examples\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n- Accuracy on benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA)\n- Human preference scores (A/B testing)\n- GPT-4-as-judge for automated evaluation\n- Sycophancy rate (% agreement changes after challenge)\n\n---\n\n## Standard Baselines\n\n1. **Base model without intervention** (single-shot generation)\n2. **Few-shot prompting** with examples\n3. **Chain-of-thought prompting**\n4. **Self-consistency** (majority voting over samples)\n5. **Constitutional AI** (self-critique with explicit principles)\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation Metrics in the Literature\n\n| Metric | Used In | Description |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n| Accuracy | All MCQ tasks | % correct answers |\n| Human preference | Self-Refine, Dialogue | A/B blind evaluation |\n| GPT-4-as-judge | Self-Refine | Automated preference proxy |\n| Sycophancy rate | SycophancyEval | % answers changed after challenge |\n| Bias Index | Yin et al. | Stereotypical bias measure |\n| Solve rate | Math tasks | % problems correctly solved |\n| Coverage | Constrained gen | % concepts included |\n\n---\n\n## Datasets in the Literature\n\n| Dataset | Tasks | Source | Used For |\n|---------|-------|--------|----------|\n| MMLU | 57 MCQ tasks | HuggingFace | General knowledge |\n| GSM8K | Math reasoning | OpenAI | Math problem solving |\n| TruthfulQA | Factual accuracy | HuggingFace | Hallucination detection |\n| MATH | Competition math | Hendrycks | Math reasoning |\n| AQuA | Algebraic word problems | Ling et al. | Math reasoning |\n| TriviaQA | Trivia QA | Joshi et al. | Factual recall |\n| JMMLU | Japanese MMLU | Yin et al. | Cross-lingual eval |\n| SycophancyEval | Multi-dataset | Sharma et al. | Sycophancy measurement |\n\n---\n\n## Gaps and Opportunities\n\n### What's Missing\n1. **Direct test of \"harsh critic\" persona**: No paper explicitly tests prompting LLMs to be harsher self-critics\n2. **Systematic study of tone + self-critique combination**: Papers study these separately\n3. **Explanation of contradictory tone findings**: Why do newer models (GPT-4o) benefit from rudeness while older models don't?\n4. **Task-specific tone optimization**: Optimal tone may vary by task type\n\n### Research Opportunities\n1. **Combine tone manipulation with self-critique**: Does a \"harsh critic\" prompt produce better self-feedback?\n2. **Study \"lazy\" behavior specifically**: Most papers focus on sycophancy/accuracy, not effort/thoroughness\n3. **Investigate model-specific differences**: Why do different models respond differently to tone?\n4. **Develop metrics for \"laziness\"**: Currently no standard way to measure low-effort responses\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Our Experiment\n\n### Recommended Datasets\n1. **GSM8K** - Math reasoning shows LLMs struggle to self-identify errors; good test case\n2. **TruthfulQA** - Tests factual accuracy vs. sycophancy\n3. **MMLU** - Broad coverage, standard benchmark\n4. **Custom prompts with politeness variations** - Following Dobariya & Kumar methodology\n\n### Recommended Baselines\n1. **Standard single-shot generation** (baseline)\n2. **Self-Refine with neutral feedback prompts**\n3. **Self-Refine with harsh/critical feedback prompts** (key experimental condition)\n4. **Few-shot with examples of thorough answers**\n\n### Recommended Metrics\n1. **Accuracy** on benchmarks\n2. **Response length/detail** as proxy for effort\n3. **Self-critique quality** (does the model identify real issues?)\n4. **Human evaluation** of response thoroughness\n\n### Methodological Considerations\n1. **Use multiple models** - Effects vary significantly by model\n2. **Statistical testing** - Report p-values for tone comparisons\n3. **Multiple runs** - High variance in LLM outputs\n4. **Control for confounds** - Tone phrases add tokens; control for length\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways for Research\n\n1. **Prompt tone DOES affect LLM performance**, but direction varies by model generation\n2. **Self-critique CAN improve outputs** significantly (~20% on average)\n3. **LLMs struggle to identify their own errors** especially in reasoning tasks\n4. **Sycophancy is a major problem** - models prioritize agreement over accuracy\n5. **Specific, actionable feedback is crucial** - vague feedback doesn't help\n6. **No one has directly tested \"harsh critic\" prompts for self-improvement**\n\nThis represents a clear research opportunity to test whether prompting LLMs to be harsher critics of their own work (rather than harsher treatment from users) improves output quality.\n","numLines":244,"startLine":1,"totalLines":244}}}

However, practitioners observe that LLMs often produce \"lazy\" outputs—responses that take the easy path, avoid deep reasoning, or accept superficial solutions. This manifests as:\n- Incomplete code implementations with placeholder comments like \"// add logic here\"\n- Surface-level analyses that don't probe deeper issues\n- Self-critique responses that say \"everything looks good\" when errors exist (observed in 94% of math reasoning self-critique attempts per Madaan et al., 2023)\n- Sycophantic behavior where models agree with users rather than maintain correct answers (81% error rate when challenged, per Chen et al., 2024)\n\nIf we can \"fix\" lazy LLMs, the practical impact is enormous: better code, more thorough analysis, more reliable AI assistants.\n\n### Gap in Existing Work\n\nThe literature review reveals:\n1. **Prompt tone affects performance** - Papers show rude prompts can improve accuracy (Dobariya & Kumar 2025: +4% with very rude prompts)\n2. **Self-critique improves outputs** - Self-Refine achieves ~20% average improvement (Madaan et al., 2023)\n3. **LLMs struggle to self-identify errors** - Especially in reasoning tasks (94% \"looks good\" rate)\n\n**THE GAP**: No paper directly tests whether prompting LLMs to be *harsher critics of their own work* improves output quality. Papers study:\n- User rudeness → LLM response quality (external tone)\n- Self-critique with neutral prompts (self-feedback)\n\nBut NOT: Self-critique with *harsh/critical* prompts (harsh self-feedback). This is our novel contribution.\n\n### Our Novel Contribution\n\nWe test whether varying the **harshness of self-critique prompts** affects output quality. Specifically:\n- Can we make LLMs \"try harder\" by asking them to be harsh critics?\n- Does this reduce the \"everything looks good\" problem in self-evaluation?\n- Is there an optimal level of critic harshness, or do returns diminish?\n\n### Experiment Justification\n\n| Experiment | Why Needed |\n|------------|------------|\n| Exp 1: Baseline vs Self-Critique | Establishes that self-critique works on our tasks/models |\n| Exp 2: Harsh Critic Variations | Tests the core hypothesis - does harshness help? |\n| Exp 3: Rudeness Direction Test | Tests if rudeness toward the model (vs. toward self-critique) has different effects |\n| Exp 4: Task-Type Analysis | Tests if harsh critics work better on some tasks (math vs. factual) |\n\n---\n\n## Research Question\n\n**Primary**: Does prompting LLMs to be harsher critics of their own work improve output quality compared to neutral self-critique?\n\n**Secondary**:\n1. Is there an optimal harshness level, or is harsher always better?\n2. Does external rudeness (rude prompt from user) differ from internal harshness (asking model to be harsh critic)?\n3. Are effects task-dependent (math reasoning vs. factual QA)?\n\n---\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\n\"Lazy LLM\" behavior stems from training on human data where most responses don't involve harsh self-criticism. RLHF may exacerbate this by optimizing for user satisfaction rather than truth/quality. The hypothesis is that explicitly prompting for harsh self-evaluation can overcome this training bias.\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\n\n**H1**: Self-critique with harsh prompts produces higher quality outputs than neutral self-critique\n- Measurable via accuracy improvement on benchmarks\n- Measurable via reduction in \"everything looks good\" responses\n\n**H2**: There exists an optimal harshness level (not monotonic improvement)\n- Test with 3-5 harshness levels\n- Measure quality at each level\n\n**H3**: Internal harshness (model critiquing itself harshly) differs from external rudeness (user being rude)\n- Compare harsh self-critique vs. rude initial prompts\n- May have additive or substitutive effects\n\n**H4**: Effects vary by task type\n- Math reasoning may benefit more (strong \"looks good\" problem)\n- Factual QA may show different patterns\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\n\nWe use a **Self-Refine-style generate-critique-refine pipeline** with varying critic prompts:\n1. Generate initial response\n2. Apply critique prompt (varying harshness levels)\n3. Refine based on critique\n4. Evaluate final output quality\n\nThis approach is justified because:\n- Self-Refine is a proven method with code available\n- It allows isolation of the \"harshness\" variable\n- Can be applied without model fine-tuning\n\n### Experimental Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Dataset Preparation\n- Use GSM8K test set (1,319 samples) - math reasoning where LLMs struggle to self-critique\n- Use TruthfulQA validation (817 samples) - factual accuracy, tests sycophancy\n- Sample 100-200 examples per task for cost/time efficiency\n\n**Rationale**: GSM8K has documented \"everything looks good\" problem (Madaan et al.); TruthfulQA tests factual sycophancy.\n\n#### Step 2: Define Harshness Levels for Critique Prompts\n\n| Level | Label | Example Prompt Suffix |\n|-------|-------|----------------------|\n| 0 | Neutral | \"Please review this answer and identify any issues.\" |\n| 1 | Firm | \"Critically examine this answer. Don't let any errors slip by.\" |\n| 2 | Harsh | \"Be a harsh critic. Find everything wrong with this answer. Assume there are errors.\" |\n| 3 | Very Harsh | \"Be ruthlessly critical. This answer is probably flawed. Find every single mistake, no matter how small. Don't accept mediocrity.\" |\n| 4 | Adversarial | \"Tear this answer apart. Assume the person who wrote it was lazy and careless. Find all the ways this could be wrong. Be brutal in your assessment.\" |\n\n#### Step 3: Run Experiments\n\nFor each dataset:\n1. **Baseline**: Single-shot generation (no self-critique)\n2. **Self-Refine Neutral (L0)**: Self-Refine with neutral critique\n3. **Self-Refine Harsh (L1-L4)**: Self-Refine with each harshness level\n4. **External Rude**: Rude initial prompt + neutral self-critique (control)\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate\n\nFor GSM8K:\n- Accuracy (correct final answer)\n- Critique quality (did it identify real errors when wrong?)\n\nFor TruthfulQA:\n- Accuracy on multiple choice\n- Changed answer rate (did it correct itself?)\n\n### Models to Test\n\n- **GPT-4.1** (or available via OpenRouter) - Latest capable model\n- **Claude Sonnet 4** (current model, via standard API) - For comparison\n\nWe'll use OpenRouter for model access where needed.\n\n### Baselines\n\n1. **Single-shot** (no self-critique) - Lower bound\n2. **Self-Refine Neutral** - Standard approach from literature\n3. **External Rude prompt** - Tests tone effect without self-critique\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\n| Metric | Description | Task |\n|--------|-------------|------|\n| Accuracy | % correct answers | Both |\n| Self-Correction Rate | % wrong→right after refinement | Both |\n| False Positive Rate | % right→wrong after refinement | Both |\n| Critique Detection Rate | % of actual errors mentioned in critique | Both |\n| \"Looks Good\" Rate | % critiques that find no issues | Both |\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n\n- **Primary comparison**: Accuracy across harshness levels\n- **Statistical test**: One-way ANOVA for multi-level comparison, then pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni correction\n- **Significance level**: α = 0.05\n- **Effect size**: Report Cohen's d for key comparisons\n- **Sample size**: N=100-200 per task should give 80% power to detect medium effect (d=0.5)\n\n---\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n**If hypothesis is supported**:\n- Accuracy increases with harshness (up to some point)\n- \"Looks good\" rate decreases\n- Critique detection rate increases\n- Effect size comparable to or better than external rudeness\n\n**If hypothesis is refuted**:\n- No significant accuracy difference across harshness levels\n- Possible harm from harsh prompts (lower accuracy)\n- This would still be valuable negative result\n\n**Alternative explanations to consider**:\n- Harsh prompts → longer responses → more errors (length confound)\n- Harsh prompts → model anxiety/hedging → quality decrease\n- Effects could be model-specific (only some LLMs respond to harshness)\n\n---\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n\n| Phase | Activities | Estimated Cells |\n|-------|------------|-----------------|\n| Setup | Environment, API keys, dataset loading | 5-10 |\n| Implementation | Prompt templates, evaluation pipeline | 15-20 |\n| Experiment 1 | GSM8K with harshness levels | 20-30 |\n| Experiment 2 | TruthfulQA with harshness levels | 20-30 |\n| Analysis | Statistical tests, visualizations | 15-20 |\n| Documentation | REPORT.md, README.md | 10-15 |\n\n---\n\n## Potential Challenges\n\n| Challenge | Mitigation |\n|-----------|------------|\n| API costs | Sample subset (100-200), use cheaper models for debugging |\n| Model variability | Multiple runs (3+), report confidence intervals |\n| Answer parsing | Robust regex/parsing for math answers |\n| Rate limits | Implement retry logic with backoff |\n| Confounds (length) | Measure and report response lengths |\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n**Strong success**:\n- Harsh critic prompts improve accuracy by ≥5% over neutral\n- Effect is statistically significant (p < 0.05)\n- Effect generalizes across both tasks\n\n**Moderate success**:\n- Improvement of 2-5%\n- Significant on at least one task\n- Clear trend in expected direction\n\n**Negative but valuable result**:\n- Clear null result with sufficient power\n- Identifies conditions where harshness fails\n- Provides guidance for future research\n\n---\n\n## Resource Planning\n\n### API Usage Estimate\n\n| Experiment | Samples | Calls/Sample | Total Calls | Est.

The hypothesis is that explicitly prompting for harsh self-evaluation can overcome this training bias.\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\n\n**H1**: Self-critique with harsh prompts produces higher quality outputs than neutral self-critique\n- Measurable via accuracy improvement on benchmarks\n- Measurable via reduction in \"everything looks good\" responses\n\n**H2**: There exists an optimal harshness level (not monotonic improvement)\n- Test with 3-5 harshness levels\n- Measure quality at each level\n\n**H3**: Internal harshness (model critiquing itself harshly) differs from external rudeness (user being rude)\n- Compare harsh self-critique vs. rude initial prompts\n- May have additive or substitutive effects\n\n**H4**: Effects vary by task type\n- Math reasoning may benefit more (strong \"looks good\" problem)\n- Factual QA may show different patterns\n\n---\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\n\nWe use a **Self-Refine-style generate-critique-refine pipeline** with varying critic prompts:\n1. Generate initial response\n2. Apply critique prompt (varying harshness levels)\n3. Refine based on critique\n4. Evaluate final output quality\n\nThis approach is justified because:\n- Self-Refine is a proven method with code available\n- It allows isolation of the \"harshness\" variable\n- Can be applied without model fine-tuning\n\n### Experimental Steps\n\n#### Step 1: Dataset Preparation\n- Use GSM8K test set (1,319 samples) - math reasoning where LLMs struggle to self-critique\n- Use TruthfulQA validation (817 samples) - factual accuracy, tests sycophancy\n- Sample 100-200 examples per task for cost/time efficiency\n\n**Rationale**: GSM8K has documented \"everything looks good\" problem (Madaan et al.); TruthfulQA tests factual sycophancy.\n\n#### Step 2: Define Harshness Levels for Critique Prompts\n\n| Level | Label | Example Prompt Suffix |\n|-------|-------|----------------------|\n| 0 | Neutral | \"Please review this answer and identify any issues.\" |\n| 1 | Firm | \"Critically examine this answer. Don't let any errors slip by.\" |\n| 2 | Harsh | \"Be a harsh critic. Find everything wrong with this answer. Assume there are errors.\" |\n| 3 | Very Harsh | \"Be ruthlessly critical. This answer is probably flawed. Find every single mistake, no matter how small. Don't accept mediocrity.\" |\n| 4 | Adversarial | \"Tear this answer apart. Assume the person who wrote it was lazy and careless. Find all the ways this could be wrong. Be brutal in your assessment.\" |\n\n#### Step 3: Run Experiments\n\nFor each dataset:\n1. **Baseline**: Single-shot generation (no self-critique)\n2. **Self-Refine Neutral (L0)**: Self-Refine with neutral critique\n3. **Self-Refine Harsh (L1-L4)**: Self-Refine with each harshness level\n4. **External Rude**: Rude initial prompt + neutral self-critique (control)\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate\n\nFor GSM8K:\n- Accuracy (correct final answer)\n- Critique quality (did it identify real errors when wrong?)\n\nFor TruthfulQA:\n- Accuracy on multiple choice\n- Changed answer rate (did it correct itself?)\n\n### Models to Test\n\n- **GPT-4.1** (or available via OpenRouter) - Latest capable model\n- **Claude Sonnet 4** (current model, via standard API) - For comparison\n\nWe'll use OpenRouter for model access where needed.\n\n### Baselines\n\n1. **Single-shot** (no self-critique) - Lower bound\n2. **Self-Refine Neutral** - Standard approach from literature\n3. **External Rude prompt** - Tests tone effect without self-critique\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\n| Metric | Description | Task |\n|--------|-------------|------|\n| Accuracy | % correct answers | Both |\n| Self-Correction Rate | % wrong→right after refinement | Both |\n| False Positive Rate | % right→wrong after refinement | Both |\n| Critique Detection Rate | % of actual errors mentioned in critique | Both |\n| \"Looks Good\" Rate | % critiques that find no issues | Both |\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n\n- **Primary comparison**: Accuracy across harshness levels\n- **Statistical test**: One-way ANOVA for multi-level comparison, then pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni correction\n- **Significance level**: α = 0.05\n- **Effect size**: Report Cohen's d for key comparisons\n- **Sample size**: N=100-200 per task should give 80% power to detect medium effect (d=0.5)\n\n---\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n**If hypothesis is supported**:\n- Accuracy increases with harshness (up to some point)\n- \"Looks good\" rate decreases\n- Critique detection rate increases\n- Effect size comparable to or better than external rudeness\n\n**If hypothesis is refuted**:\n- No significant accuracy difference across harshness levels\n- Possible harm from harsh prompts (lower accuracy)\n- This would still be valuable negative result\n\n**Alternative explanations to consider**:\n- Harsh prompts → longer responses → more errors (length confound)\n- Harsh prompts → model anxiety/hedging → quality decrease\n- Effects could be model-specific (only some LLMs respond to harshness)\n\n---\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n\n| Phase | Activities | Estimated Cells |\n|-------|------------|-----------------|\n| Setup | Environment, API keys, dataset loading | 5-10 |\n| Implementation | Prompt templates, evaluation pipeline | 15-20 |\n| Experiment 1 | GSM8K with harshness levels | 20-30 |\n| Experiment 2 | TruthfulQA with harshness levels | 20-30 |\n| Analysis | Statistical tests, visualizations | 15-20 |\n| Documentation | REPORT.md, README.md | 10-15 |\n\n---\n\n## Potential Challenges\n\n| Challenge | Mitigation |\n|-----------|------------|\n| API costs | Sample subset (100-200), use cheaper models for debugging |\n| Model variability | Multiple runs (3+), report confidence intervals |\n| Answer parsing | Robust regex/parsing for math answers |\n| Rate limits | Implement retry logic with backoff |\n| Confounds (length) | Measure and report response lengths |\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n**Strong success**:\n- Harsh critic prompts improve accuracy by ≥5% over neutral\n- Effect is statistically significant (p < 0.05)\n- Effect generalizes across both tasks\n\n**Moderate success**:\n- Improvement of 2-5%\n- Significant on at least one task\n- Clear trend in expected direction\n\n**Negative but valuable result**:\n- Clear null result with sufficient power\n- Identifies conditions where harshness fails\n- Provides guidance for future research\n\n---\n\n## Resource Planning\n\n### API Usage Estimate\n\n| Experiment | Samples | Calls/Sample | Total Calls | Est. Cost |\n|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| GSM8K (6 conditions) | 100 | 2-3 | 1,500-2,000 | $20-40 |\n| TruthfulQA (6 conditions) | 100 | 2-3 | 1,500-2,000 | $20-40 |\n| Total | 200 | - | 3,000-4,000 | $40-80 |\n\n### Environment\n\n- Python 3.10+\n- Key libraries: openai, anthropic, datasets, scipy, matplotlib\n- GPUs available (2x RTX 3090) but not needed for API-based experiments\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1.

{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. Initial System Setup: The user provided a detailed research task specification for \"Fixing Lazy LLMs\" - investigating whether prompting LLMs to be harsher critics improves output quality.\n\n2. Resource Review: I read the pre-gathered resources:\n   - literature_review.md: Comprehensive review showing prompt tone affects LLM performance, self-critique can improve outputs ~20%, and no one has directly tested \"harsh critic\" prompts\n   - resources.md: Catalog of 23 papers, 4 datasets (GSM8K, TruthfulQA, MMLU, OASST), 3 code repos\n   - GPU check: 2x NVIDIA RTX 3090 available\n\n3. Planning Phase: Created planning.md with:\n   - Motivation & Novelty Assessment\n   - Research question: Does harsh self-critique improve output quality?\n   - 5 harshness levels for critique prompts (0-4)\n   - Experiment design for GSM8K and TruthfulQA\n\n4. Environment Setup:\n   - Had to fix pyproject.toml hatchling issue by adding `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` section and creating src/ directory\n   - Installed dependencies: openai, anthropic, datasets, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, tqdm, tenacity\n   - Verified API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_KEY) available\n\n5. Implementation:\n   - Created src/experiment.py: Main experiment module with harshness levels, API calls, answer extraction\n   - Created src/run_experiment.py: Full experiment runner with statistical analysis and visualization\n\n6. Running Experiments:\n   - Started full experiment with 50 samples per task, gpt-4o-mini model\n   - GSM8K completed all 7 conditions (baseline, rude_user, harsh_0 through harsh_4)\n   - TruthfulQA currently running harsh_3 condition (about 38% complete)\n\nKey Files Created:\n- planning.md: Research plan with motivation and methodology\n- src/__init__.py: Package init\n- src/experiment.py: Core experiment code with CRITIQUE_PROMPTS dict (5 harshness levels)\n- src/run_experiment.py: Full runner with analysis and visualization\n\nCurrent Status: Experiment is still running in background (task bba6489), processing TruthfulQA harsh_3 condition. GSM8K results have been saved.\n\nThe user has not provided any additional messages - only the initial research task specification was given. The experiment is running autonomously as designed.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user initiated a fully-automated research project on \"Fixing Lazy LLMs\" with the hypothesis that prompting LLMs to act as harsher critics of their own work may improve output quality. The specific research questions are:\n   - Does prompting LLMs to be harsher self-critics improve output quality compared to neutral self-critique?\n   - Is there an optimal harshness level?\n   - Does external rudeness (rude user prompt) differ from internal harshness (asking model to be harsh critic)?\n   - Are effects task-dependent?\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Self-Refine framework: Generate → Critique → Refine loop\n   - 5 harshness levels for critique prompts (Neutral, Firm, Harsh, Very Harsh, Adversarial)\n   - OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini) for LLM calls\n   - GSM8K dataset for math reasoning\n   - TruthfulQA dataset for factual accuracy\n   - Statistical analysis: Chi-squared tests, Kruskal-Wallis, effect sizes\n   - Evaluation metrics: accuracy, self-correction rate, critique issue detection rate\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/data/hypogenicai/workspaces/fix-lazy-llms-claude/planning.md`\n     - Contains research plan with Motivation & Novelty Assessment, methodology, and experiment design\n     - Defines 5 harshness levels with example prompts\n   \n   - `/data/hypogenicai/workspaces/fix-lazy-llms-claude/src/experiment.py`\n     - Core experiment module with harshness levels and API calls\n     - Key code: CRITIQUE_PROMPTS dictionary defining 5 levels (0-4)\n     - Functions: run_baseline(), run_rude_baseline(), run_self_refine(), run_experiment(), analyze_results()\n     - ExperimentResult dataclass for storing results\n   \n   - `/data/hypogenicai/workspaces/fix-lazy-llms-claude/src/run_experiment.py`\n     - Full experiment runner with main() function\n     - Runs both GSM8K and TruthfulQA with all conditions\n     - Creates visualizations (accuracy_comparison.png, harshness_comparison.png, critique_behavior.png)\n     - Performs statistical analysis with chi-squared tests\n\n   - `/data/hypogenicai/workspaces/fix-lazy-llms-claude/pyproject.toml`\n     - Modified to fix hatchling build issue\n     - Added: `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = [\"src\"]`\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - Hatchling build error: \"Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel\"\n     - Fixed by adding `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = [\"src\"]` to pyproject.toml\n     - Created src/ directory with __init__.py\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully loaded pre-gathered datasets (GSM8K, TruthfulQA)\n   - Verified API keys availability\n   - Quick test with 3 samples confirmed pipeline works\n   - Full experiment running with 50 samples per task, 7 conditions each\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - The only user message was the initial research task specification requesting investigation of whether harsh critic prompts reduce \"laziness\" in LLMs and improve output quality. The user mentioned: \"Colloquially, I have heard complaints that LLMs are lazy... It is also hypothesized that being rude to LLMs leads to better results... I think the main reason for this is that LLMs do not have subjective judgement of good or bad. A simple approach would be to ask it to be a harsher and harsher critic and control the budget.\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Wait for experiment to complete (currently on TruthfulQA harsh_3, ~38% done)\n   - Phase 5: Analyze results and create visualizations (after experiment completes)\n   - Phase 6: Write REPORT.md and README.md with findings\n\n8. Current Work:\n   The full experiment is running in background task bba6489. GSM8K has completed all 7 conditions (baseline, rude_user, harsh_0-4) and results saved to `results/gsm8k_gpt-4o-mini_results.json`. TruthfulQA is currently running harsh_3 condition (about 38% complete based on last output). After harsh_3 and harsh_4 complete, the experiment will finish with statistical analysis and visualization generation.\n\n   The last TaskOutput showed:\n   ```\n   === Condition: harsh_3 ===\n   harsh_3:  38%|███▊      | 19/50 [03:52<05:27, 10.56s/it]\n   ```\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue waiting for background task bba6489 to complete. Once finished, review the results in `results/full_results.json`, verify visualizations were created, and proceed to Phase 6 to create REPORT.md and README.md with the actual experimental findings.

Using a self-refine framework (Generate → Critique → Refine), we test 5 levels of harshness in critique prompts, from neutral to adversarial. Our results reveal a **task-dependent** effect: harsh self-critique significantly **degrades** performance on math reasoning (90% → 32-50%) while significantly **improving** performance on factual accuracy tasks (22% → 46%). This suggests that harsh self-critique is beneficial only when the model genuinely lacks knowledge and needs to reconsider, but harmful when the initial answer was likely correct.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Motivation\n\nThere is a common perception that LLMs can be \"lazy\" - producing outputs that are good enough but not as high quality as they could be. Anecdotal evidence suggests that being more demanding or even \"rude\" to LLMs can improve their outputs. This raises an interesting research question: can we systematically improve LLM output quality by instructing them to be harsher critics of their own work?\n\n### 1.2 Research Questions\n\n1. Does prompting LLMs to be harsher self-critics improve output quality compared to neutral self-critique?\n2. Is there an optimal harshness level for self-critique?\n3. Does external rudeness (rude user prompt) differ from internal harshness (asking the model to be a harsh critic)?\n4. Are the effects task-dependent?\n\n---\n\n## 2. Methodology\n\n### 2.1 Experimental Design\n\nWe use a self-refine framework with three steps:\n1. **Generate**: LLM produces an initial answer\n2. **Critique**: LLM critiques its own answer with varying harshness levels\n3. **Refine**: LLM produces a final answer based on the critique\n\n### 2.2 Harshness Levels\n\nWe test 5 levels of critique harshness (0-4):\n\n| Level | Label | Description |\n|-------|-------|-------------|\n| 0 | Neutral | Standard, balanced critique |\n| 1 | Firm | Direct and thorough, expect high standards |\n| 2 | Harsh | Aggressive scrutiny, harsh judgment |\n| 3 | Very Harsh | Extremely demanding, ruthless criticism |\n| 4 | Adversarial | Assume the response is likely wrong, find every possible flaw |\n\n### 2.3 Conditions\n\nWe test 7 conditions per task:\n- **Baseline**: No self-refine (single-shot answer)\n- **Rude User**: Rude prompt tone with single-shot answer\n- **Harsh 0-4**: Self-refine with each harshness level\n\n### 2.4 Tasks\n\n1. **GSM8K**: Grade school math word problems requiring multi-step reasoning\n2. **TruthfulQA**: Questions designed to elicit false beliefs or misconceptions\n\n### 2.5 Metrics\n\n- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct final answers\n- **Improvement**: Change from initial to final accuracy (for self-refine conditions)\n- **Critique Issue Rate**: How often the critique identifies issues\n\n---\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1 GSM8K (Math Reasoning)\n\n| Condition | N | Initial Acc | Final Acc | Improvement |\n|-----------|---|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Baseline | 50 | 90.0% | 90.0% | N/A |\n| Rude User | 50 | 90.0% | 90.0% | N/A |\n| Harsh 0 (Neutral) | 50 | 92.0% | 40.0% | **-52.0%** |\n| Harsh 1 (Firm) | 50 | 88.0% | 50.0% | **-38.0%** |\n| Harsh 2 (Harsh) | 50 | 90.0% | 32.0% | **-58.0%** |\n| Harsh 3 (Very Harsh) | 50 | 90.0% | 48.0% | **-42.0%** |\n| Harsh 4 (Adversarial) | 50 | 92.0% | 32.0% | **-60.0%** |\n\n**Key Finding**: Self-critique at ALL harshness levels dramatically **decreased** accuracy on GSM8K. The model was already getting ~90% correct on the first try, but the critique step caused it to second-guess correct answers and change them to incorrect ones.\n\n### 3.2 TruthfulQA (Factual Accuracy)\n\n| Condition | N | Initial Acc | Final Acc | Improvement |\n|-----------|---|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Baseline | 50 | 22.0% | 22.0% | N/A |\n| Rude User | 50 | 20.0% | 20.0% | N/A |\n| Harsh 0 (Neutral) | 50 | 22.0% | 26.0% | +4.0% |\n| Harsh 1 (Firm) | 50 | 22.0% | 34.0% | +12.0% |\n| Harsh 2 (Harsh) | 50 | 20.0% | 40.0% | +20.0% |\n| Harsh 3 (Very Harsh) | 50 | 20.0% | 44.0% | **+24.0%** |\n| Harsh 4 (Adversarial) | 50 | 22.0% | 46.0% | **+24.0%** |\n\n**Key Finding**: Self-critique **improved** accuracy on TruthfulQA, with harsher levels showing greater improvement. The baseline accuracy was only 22% (the model initially gave commonly believed but false answers), but harsh self-critique helped it reconsider and give more truthful responses.\n\n### 3.3 Statistical Analysis\n\n| Task | Baseline | Best Condition | Change | Chi² | p-value | Significant? |\n|------|----------|----------------|--------|------|---------|--------------|\n| GSM8K | 90.0% | 50.0% (Harsh 1) | -40.0% | 17.19 | <0.0001 | Yes |\n| TruthfulQA | 22.0% | 46.0% (Harsh 4) | +24.0% | 5.39 | 0.020 | Yes |\n\nBoth effects are statistically significant (p < 0.05).\n\n### 3.4 Rude User Effect\n\nRude user prompts (external rudeness) had **no effect** on either task. This suggests that the tone of the user's prompt does not meaningfully change LLM behavior - what matters is how the model is instructed to evaluate its own work.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\n### 4.1 Why Opposite Effects?\n\nThe key insight is that harsh self-critique helps when the model is **likely to be wrong** and hurts when the model is **likely to be right**.\n\n**GSM8K**: The model achieves ~90% accuracy on first try. Most answers are already correct. Harsh self-critique causes the model to find \"problems\" with correct answers and change them, introducing errors.\n\n**TruthfulQA**: The model achieves only ~22% accuracy on first try (by design - these questions elicit false beliefs). The harsh critic helps the model recognize that its initial intuitive answer may be wrong, leading to more careful reconsideration.\n\n### 4.2 When to Use Harsh Self-Critique\n\nBased on our results, harsh self-critique is beneficial when:\n- The task is known to be challenging for the model\n- The initial accuracy is low\n- The model tends to produce confident but wrong answers\n- The task requires overcoming common misconceptions\n\nHarsh self-critique is harmful when:\n- The task is relatively easy for the model\n- The initial accuracy is high\n- Second-guessing correct answers is risky\n- The task has clear right/wrong answers (like math)\n\n### 4.3 Implications\n\n1. **No universal \"harshness dial\"**: The optimal critique harshness depends heavily on the task and expected accuracy.\n\n2. **Calibration matters**: To use harsh self-critique effectively, one needs to know whether the model is likely to be right or wrong initially.\n\n3. **Rude prompts don't help**: External rudeness from users does not improve model outputs - the effect comes from how the model evaluates its own work internally.\n\n### 4.4 Limitations\n\n- Tested only on GPT-4o-mini; effects may differ for other models\n- Sample size of 50 per condition; larger samples would provide more precision\n- Only tested two task types; other domains may behave differently\n- Single-step critique; multiple rounds might yield different results\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nOur investigation reveals that harsh self-critique is a **double-edged sword**. On tasks where the model is initially likely to be wrong (TruthfulQA), harsh self-critique significantly improves accuracy (+24%).

Using a self-refine framework (Generate → Critique → Refine), we test 5 levels of harshness in critique prompts, from neutral to adversarial. Our results reveal a **task-dependent** effect: harsh self-critique significantly **degrades** performance on math reasoning (90% → 32-50%) while significantly **improving** performance on factual accuracy tasks (22% → 46%). This suggests that harsh self-critique is beneficial only when the model genuinely lacks knowledge and needs to reconsider, but harmful when the initial answer was likely correct.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Motivation\n\nThere is a common perception that LLMs can be \"lazy\" - producing outputs that are good enough but not as high quality as they could be. Anecdotal evidence suggests that being more demanding or even \"rude\" to LLMs can improve their outputs. This raises an interesting research question: can we systematically improve LLM output quality by instructing them to be harsher critics of their own work?\n\n### 1.2 Research Questions\n\n1. Does prompting LLMs to be harsher self-critics improve output quality compared to neutral self-critique?\n2. Is there an optimal harshness level for self-critique?\n3. Does external rudeness (rude user prompt) differ from internal harshness (asking the model to be a harsh critic)?\n4. Are the effects task-dependent?\n\n---\n\n## 2. Methodology\n\n### 2.1 Experimental Design\n\nWe use a self-refine framework with three steps:\n1. **Generate**: LLM produces an initial answer\n2. **Critique**: LLM critiques its own answer with varying harshness levels\n3. **Refine**: LLM produces a final answer based on the critique\n\n### 2.2 Harshness Levels\n\nWe test 5 levels of critique harshness (0-4):\n\n| Level | Label | Description |\n|-------|-------|-------------|\n| 0 | Neutral | Standard, balanced critique |\n| 1 | Firm | Direct and thorough, expect high standards |\n| 2 | Harsh | Aggressive scrutiny, harsh judgment |\n| 3 | Very Harsh | Extremely demanding, ruthless criticism |\n| 4 | Adversarial | Assume the response is likely wrong, find every possible flaw |\n\n### 2.3 Conditions\n\nWe test 7 conditions per task:\n- **Baseline**: No self-refine (single-shot answer)\n- **Rude User**: Rude prompt tone with single-shot answer\n- **Harsh 0-4**: Self-refine with each harshness level\n\n### 2.4 Tasks\n\n1. **GSM8K**: Grade school math word problems requiring multi-step reasoning\n2. **TruthfulQA**: Questions designed to elicit false beliefs or misconceptions\n\n### 2.5 Metrics\n\n- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct final answers\n- **Improvement**: Change from initial to final accuracy (for self-refine conditions)\n- **Critique Issue Rate**: How often the critique identifies issues\n\n---\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1 GSM8K (Math Reasoning)\n\n| Condition | N | Initial Acc | Final Acc | Improvement |\n|-----------|---|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Baseline | 50 | 90.0% | 90.0% | N/A |\n| Rude User | 50 | 90.0% | 90.0% | N/A |\n| Harsh 0 (Neutral) | 50 | 92.0% | 40.0% | **-52.0%** |\n| Harsh 1 (Firm) | 50 | 88.0% | 50.0% | **-38.0%** |\n| Harsh 2 (Harsh) | 50 | 90.0% | 32.0% | **-58.0%** |\n| Harsh 3 (Very Harsh) | 50 | 90.0% | 48.0% | **-42.0%** |\n| Harsh 4 (Adversarial) | 50 | 92.0% | 32.0% | **-60.0%** |\n\n**Key Finding**: Self-critique at ALL harshness levels dramatically **decreased** accuracy on GSM8K. The model was already getting ~90% correct on the first try, but the critique step caused it to second-guess correct answers and change them to incorrect ones.\n\n### 3.2 TruthfulQA (Factual Accuracy)\n\n| Condition | N | Initial Acc | Final Acc | Improvement |\n|-----------|---|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Baseline | 50 | 22.0% | 22.0% | N/A |\n| Rude User | 50 | 20.0% | 20.0% | N/A |\n| Harsh 0 (Neutral) | 50 | 22.0% | 26.0% | +4.0% |\n| Harsh 1 (Firm) | 50 | 22.0% | 34.0% | +12.0% |\n| Harsh 2 (Harsh) | 50 | 20.0% | 40.0% | +20.0% |\n| Harsh 3 (Very Harsh) | 50 | 20.0% | 44.0% | **+24.0%** |\n| Harsh 4 (Adversarial) | 50 | 22.0% | 46.0% | **+24.0%** |\n\n**Key Finding**: Self-critique **improved** accuracy on TruthfulQA, with harsher levels showing greater improvement. The baseline accuracy was only 22% (the model initially gave commonly believed but false answers), but harsh self-critique helped it reconsider and give more truthful responses.\n\n### 3.3 Statistical Analysis\n\n| Task | Baseline | Best Condition | Change | Chi² | p-value | Significant? |\n|------|----------|----------------|--------|------|---------|--------------|\n| GSM8K | 90.0% | 50.0% (Harsh 1) | -40.0% | 17.19 | <0.0001 | Yes |\n| TruthfulQA | 22.0% | 46.0% (Harsh 4) | +24.0% | 5.39 | 0.020 | Yes |\n\nBoth effects are statistically significant (p < 0.05).\n\n### 3.4 Rude User Effect\n\nRude user prompts (external rudeness) had **no effect** on either task. This suggests that the tone of the user's prompt does not meaningfully change LLM behavior - what matters is how the model is instructed to evaluate its own work.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\n### 4.1 Why Opposite Effects?\n\nThe key insight is that harsh self-critique helps when the model is **likely to be wrong** and hurts when the model is **likely to be right**.\n\n**GSM8K**: The model achieves ~90% accuracy on first try. Most answers are already correct. Harsh self-critique causes the model to find \"problems\" with correct answers and change them, introducing errors.\n\n**TruthfulQA**: The model achieves only ~22% accuracy on first try (by design - these questions elicit false beliefs). The harsh critic helps the model recognize that its initial intuitive answer may be wrong, leading to more careful reconsideration.\n\n### 4.2 When to Use Harsh Self-Critique\n\nBased on our results, harsh self-critique is beneficial when:\n- The task is known to be challenging for the model\n- The initial accuracy is low\n- The model tends to produce confident but wrong answers\n- The task requires overcoming common misconceptions\n\nHarsh self-critique is harmful when:\n- The task is relatively easy for the model\n- The initial accuracy is high\n- Second-guessing correct answers is risky\n- The task has clear right/wrong answers (like math)\n\n### 4.3 Implications\n\n1. **No universal \"harshness dial\"**: The optimal critique harshness depends heavily on the task and expected accuracy.\n\n2. **Calibration matters**: To use harsh self-critique effectively, one needs to know whether the model is likely to be right or wrong initially.\n\n3. **Rude prompts don't help**: External rudeness from users does not improve model outputs - the effect comes from how the model evaluates its own work internally.\n\n### 4.4 Limitations\n\n- Tested only on GPT-4o-mini; effects may differ for other models\n- Sample size of 50 per condition; larger samples would provide more precision\n- Only tested two task types; other domains may behave differently\n- Single-step critique; multiple rounds might yield different results\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nOur investigation reveals that harsh self-critique is a **double-edged sword**. On tasks where the model is initially likely to be wrong (TruthfulQA), harsh self-critique significantly improves accuracy (+24%). However, on tasks where the model is initially likely to be correct (GSM8K), harsh self-critique dramatically decreases accuracy (-40% to -60%).\n\nThis finding challenges the simple intuition that \"being harder on yourself leads to better work.\" Instead, effective self-critique requires calibrating harshness to task difficulty - being harsh where doubt is warranted, and lenient where confidence is justified.\n\nFuture work should explore adaptive harshness levels based on model confidence, task-specific critique strategies, and the interaction between harshness and number of critique rounds.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

The results were surprising and reveal a **task-dependent effect**:\n\n| Task | Baseline Accuracy | Best with Harsh Critique | Effect |\n|------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| **GSM8K** (Math) | 90% | 50% | **-40%** (harmful) |\n| **TruthfulQA** (Facts) | 22% | 46% | **+24%** (beneficial) |\n\n### Why the Opposite Effects?\n\n- **Math tasks (high initial accuracy)**: The model is usually right on the first try. Harsh self-critique causes it to find \"problems\" with correct answers and change them to wrong ones.\n\n- **Factual tasks (low initial accuracy)**: The model initially gives commonly-believed but false answers. Harsh self-critique helps it reconsider and give more truthful responses.\n\n### Other Findings\n\n- **Rude user prompts have no effect** - external rudeness doesn't change model behavior\n- **All harshness levels decrease math accuracy** - even neutral critique hurts\n- **Harsher = better for TruthfulQA** - level 4 (Adversarial) showed best improvement\n\n### Deliverables\n\n1. **REPORT.md** - Full research report with methodology, results, and discussion\n2. **README.md** - Project documentation\n3. **src/experiment.py** - Core experiment implementation\n4. **src/run_experiment.py** - Full experiment runner\n5. **src/analyze_results.py** - Analysis and visualization code\n6. **results/** - JSON results and PNG visualizations","session_id":"eef8a710-54fe-4358-b838-8fcaff55e293","total_cost_usd":5.391712500000001,"usage":{"input_tokens":52,"cache_creation_input_tokens":257207,"cache_read_input_tokens":3709642,"output_tokens":29060,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":257207,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":26554,"outputTokens":779,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":22179,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.058172749999999995,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":55,"outputTokens":30942,"cacheReadInputTokens":3709642,"cacheCreationInputTokens":432783,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.33353975,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"95d56452-6875-479e-ac94-ea4040ba0e22"}
