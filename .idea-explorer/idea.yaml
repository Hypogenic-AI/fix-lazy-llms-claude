  title: Fixing Lazy LLMs
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models (LLMs) tend to prefer easy or low-effort responses
    due to a lack of subjective judgment of good or bad; prompting LLMs to act as
    harsher critics or varying prompt tone (e.g., being rude) may improve their output
    quality. Investigating whether these approaches reduce "laziness" in LLMs and
    exploring alternative methods can lead to more effective LLM behavior.

    '
  background:
    description: 'Colloquially, I have heard complaints that LLMs are lazy. They kind
      of prefer to take the easy way out without trying very hard. It is also hypothesized
      that being rude to LLMs leads to better results.

      I think the main reason for this is that LLMs do not have subjective judgement
      of good or bad. A simple approach would be to ask it to be a harsher and harsher
      critic and control the budget.

      Does this approach work? Are there other approaches?'
