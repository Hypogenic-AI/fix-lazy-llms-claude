Summary:
- Literature review covers prompt tone effects, self-critique, and sycophancy
- Key finding: Contradictory evidence on tone effects (newer models may benefit from rude prompts)
- Self-Refine methodology shows ~20% improvement through self-critique
- Sycophancy is well-documented (~58% of LLM responses are sycophantic)
- Research opportunity: Testing "harsh critic" self-critique (not directly studied)

Recommended experiment approach:
1. Use GSM8K dataset (LLMs show "lazy" self-evaluation on math)
2. Compare standard vs harsh critic self-feedback prompts
3. Measure accuracy and self-critique quality
4. Adapt Self-Refine codebase for experiments
